Data Processing and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Practical Implementation

Overview
This repository contains Python implementations of various data processing techniques and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) performed on different datasets. The repository includes practical applications such as handling missing values, EDA, and performing various transformations on a handmade dataset.

Practicals Covered
4. Treating Missing Values
- Implemented multiple techniques to handle missing values, including:
  - Mean/Median/Mode Imputation
  - Forward/Backward Fill
  - Dropping Missing Values
  - Using Predictive Models
  
5. Performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Conducted EDA on a given dataset, covering:
  - Summary statistics
  - Data visualization (Histograms, Boxplots, Scatterplots)
  - Correlation Analysis
  - Identifying Outliers

6. Data Transformation on Handmade Dataset
- Applied the following transformations:
  - NameUpper: Converted text data to uppercase.
  - Multicast: Transformed data based on multiple criteria.
  - Conditional Split: Split data conditionally based on values.
  - Aggregation: Grouped and aggregated data.
  - Sort: Sorted dataset based on specific columns.
  - Derived Column: Created new features from existing data.

Requirements
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
